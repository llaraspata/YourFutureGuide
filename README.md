This project was shown during the European Research Night 2024 in Bari. Therefore the degree course prediction was limited to what proposed by the University of Bari in that moment. 
So, a Retreival Augmeted Generation (RAG) mechanism has been implemented at the end of the conversation to retrieve the three degree couses most similar to the student's interests.

> [!NOTE]
> Since this is a demo for the European Research Night 2024 in Bari, the conversation is in Italian.

## üöÄ Getting started

We recommend to use [Python 3.11.5](https://python.domainunion.de/downloads/release/python-3115/) to run our code, due to possible incompatibiities with newr versions.

Moreover, the frontend part of this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.4. So, be sure that Angular is installed on your machine. You can find details on how to install it in the [Angular Github repository(https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)].
